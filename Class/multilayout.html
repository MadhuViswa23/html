            <p>“We want to be able to capture these young women in FIRST Robotics … there are a lot of volunteer efforts
                that I am encouraging our chapter to do,” Garcia said. “But more so, I’d like these ladies to get
                involved with judging, because they have that skill set.”

                One of the first collaborators in this effort, the New Hampshire-based FIRST Robotics, works throughout
                schools in the area to introduce students to the STEM field through robotics competitions. Now the
                organization is partnering with WiR to extend the student experience.

                “It’s not limited to FIRST. [The] big picture for this chapter is offering that mentorship [and]
                providing these young women in STEM support for careers they want to pursue,” Garcia said.

                Ivy Vasquez Sandoval, a mentor in the chapter, is a San Antonio native and product of the city’s public
                school system who after over a decade in customer service decided to start her journey into tech. Now in
                leadership at Plus One Robotics,

            <h2>Global female robotics nonprofit<br> plants roots in San Antonio</h2>
            <p>Nearly three years ago, Women in Robotics started a grassroots initiative to bring more female talent
                into the tech industry, specifically in the male-dominated robotics field. Now a global nonprofit
                network, the group is starting its newest chapter in San Antonio.
                <br><img
                    src="https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12522691/kimberley-hayes-051823-01*540xx5700-3202-0-218.jpg"><br>
                The San Antonio chapter of Women in Robotics (WiR) is the group’s only one in Texas.

                Home to a fast-growing tech industry and longstanding learning institutions, the city was an ideal place
                for the group to grow, according to Stephanie Garcia, business development and communications specialist
                for Port San Antonio, which helped stand up the San Antonio effort.
          
                The percentage of women in STEM — science, technology, engineering and math — and more specifically
                robotics has been historically low, according to census data, but Women in Robotics is hoping to be a
                part of that change.

                The group’s goal is “to bring together a community that was siloed at one point,” Garcia said, adding
                that the tech industry in the past was insular and hard to break into, especially for women.

                San Antonio’s WiR chapter will host panels and exhibits, host industry- and school-based robotics
                competitions and provide opportunities for mentorship through nonprofits like FIRST Robotics and Girls
                Inc. of San Antonio.

                One of the program’s biggest goals is to “connect and engage with younger females,” Garcia said. The
                group aims to serve students locally throughout schools in the San Antonio area, beginning with Lutheran
                High School of San Antonio, which is a part of the FIRST Robotics program.
                <img src="https://i0.wp.com/sanantonioreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nickwagner-cyber-security-geekdom-technology-17AUG22-4.jpg?resize=1200%2C738&ssl=1">
                “There’s a place for everyone in robotics,” she added. The group’s website notes that nonbinary people
                are welcome in its various chapters.

                WiR has already begun the work spearheading new efforts with schools like Lutheran, where students gain
                the chance to start their path into STEM while being mentored by a professional in the industry. Mentors
                both locally and across the country make themselves available to the students, who get to participate in
                activities like programming and fabricating robots in competitive settings.

                When Joyce Pingel went looking for experts who could help the Holt family of businesses integrate their
                technology, she found an opportunity.


                Pingel, Holt’s chief information officer and head of digital innovation, found plenty of companies
                offering systems integration — the creation and management of processes that integrate the disparate
                technologies companies use to
                run their businesses. But Pingel found a distinct lack of those that also
                had deep expertise in the industrial sector.

                She took her “a-ha moment” to Holt leadership, and was encouraged to pursue what has become Epiphany
                Industrial Technologies, which launched in January 2022. Holt businesses include Holt Cat, one of the
                largest Caterpillar dealership networks in the country; Holt Manufacturing; Holt Renewables; and others.
                The Holt family is also the majority owner of the San Antonio Spurs.
            </p>





       
        

            <p>Mayor Ron Nirenberg joined Holt CEO Peter J. Holt; Corinna Holt Richter, president and chief
                administrative officer of Holt; Councilwoman Phyllis Viagran (D3); and her sister Rebecca Viagran, a
                former councilwoman who is now president and CEO of the South Texas Business Partnership (formerly the
                South San Antonio Chamber of Commerce), for the open house.

                In her remarks, Pingel described systems integrators as akin to general contractors; Epiphany, she said,
                will eventually serve industrial customers in the construction, oil and gas, renewables and
                manufacturing industries.

                The Holt family of companies was Epiphany’s first customer, she said later, helping them while ironing
                out the startup’s processes. Later this year, she said, Epiphany will start to court outside customers,
                including other Caterpillar dealers.

                Pingel initially led a team of three — herself, Vice President of Solution Engineering Dinu Mathai and
                Vice President of Solution Delivery David Kash — in forming the company. Today it has 15 employees, she
                said, and expects to double that figure by the end of 2023</p>
            <h2>Holt-backed industrial tech company celebrates refurbished home in Southeast San Antonio</h2>
            <p>“We’re bringing high-skill, high-tech jobs to the South Side,” she said to applause from the crowd of
                business leaders, elected officials and South Side boosters.

                The company is hiring for positions such as solutions architect, data integration engineer and senior
                Salesforce developer, according to its website. Mathai said as it fills its senior ranks, Epiphany also
                hopes to expand opportunities for more recent graduates and interns “to fill the pipeline.”

                He acknowledged that it’s been a struggle to hire locally, and expanding their search statewide helped
                round out the company’s leadership team. A partially remote and hybrid workforce is the reality, Mathai
                said, but he hopes the amenities of the new headquarters will help attract workers to San Antonio.
           
            But “we love to hire local,” said Kash, “and the tables are turning, things are picking up.”

            Access to a qualified workforce and the ability to attract and retain talent is a top priority for the South
            Texas Business Partnership, said Rebecca Viagran. The former Southside chamber, which merged with the West
            San Antonio Chamber of Commerce in 2020, now considers not just the South Side but all of South Texas as its
            service region.

            The economic center of San Antonio is “shifting ever southward,” said Nirenberg. “The amenities coming to
            the South Side are not to be overstated.”

            Peter Holt said his company is “pleased to be a part” of the South Side’s growth, and lauded Pingel’s
            vision. <img

            “When new ideas come up,” he said, “let’s run through the door together.”
            NASA’s goal is to land an astronaut on Mars by the late 2030s. But before then, it needs to build a lunar
            base as a midway point. And to build a lunar base, it needs a landing pad. To build a landing pad, it needs
            a space architect.

            That’s Sam Ximenes, whose San Antonio-based venture Astroport Space Technologies recently won its second
            small business grant from NASA to continue its joint research with UTSA on how to design robots that can
            build a landing pad on the moon.

            “The technology is here,” Ximenes said. “It’s not Star Trek anymore. It’s not fantasy. This is real.”
            Astroport’s first contract with NASA last year helped it develop a furnace that could liquefy moon dust and
            form it into Lego-like bricks. This latest contract seeks a solution to a related problem: how to feed the
            furnace.

            Astroport, founded in 2020 as a subsidiary of a larger company, is now chasing designs for robots — either
            autonomous or remote-controlled or somewhere in between — that could scoop the moon dust, which is finely
            granulated lunar soil or regolith, and get it into the furnace.
            Though the resulting bricks could be used for a variety of base-building purposes, the immediate objective
            is to build a landing pad. It’s a necessity. When a space vessel lands or launches from the lunar surface,
            it launches the surrounding soil into the air, similar to how a landing helicopter blows grass but with a
            far more extreme velocity.’
            <img src="https://techbullion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Denis-Ledenkov-CEO-of-Robosculptor-1000x504.png"><br>
            “It’s so energetic that the dust goes into orbit and forms a cloud orbiting the moon,” Ximenes said. “That
            causes havoc and danger for incoming spacecraft.”

            And in addition to the permanent smokescreen it could create, the shower of high-speed moon dust could
            sandblast any existing equipment on the moon such as tractors and habitats.

            UTSA is Astroport’s research partner for the project. Professors Sazzad Bin-Shafique and Ibukun Awolusi are
            leading the research, to which graduate students also will also contribute.

            MORE FROM SAN ANTONIO REPORT

San Antonio’s cybersecurity sector is strong but lopsided, said local industry leaders who participated in a Geekdom panel.

    While many companies in the city’s defense sector and beyond provide cybersecurity services — investigators, auditors and consultants — relatively few actually build software, which is where the big money is. And those that do often get whisked away to Austin.
    “The ability to build product and have people building product … is going to be extremely important for longevity in the industry,” said Nicholas Hollis, president and CEO of Coherent Cyber, a San Antonio-based cybersecurity services firm. “The challenge for us is to keep those product companies and developers here.”

    The Wednesday panel, coordinated by the World Affairs Council of San Antonio, was moderated by Charles Woodin, CEO of Geekdom. Thomas Ervin, a UTSA lecturer and cybersecurity specialist at the FBI’s San Antonio office, and Jeff Fair, vice president of cybersecurity at the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce, also took part in the discussion.
    
    Hollis brought up the example of Infocyte, a malware-hunting software startup founded by U.S. Air Force veterans that Hollis was a major investor in. The company was founded in San Antonio, where it also participated in the Build Sec Foundry, a former San Antonio-based incubator for cybersecurity software startups. Sometime after Infocyte raised $3.4 million from Austin investors in 2017, it moved to Austin.
    
    The only other company that graduated out of the Build Sec Foundry incubator also moved out of San Antonio after being bought, Hollis said. “We lost those high-quality jobs.”
    
    Woodin echoed the point: “The problem is not building products in San Antonio, it’s finding the funding to keep it here.” Companies end up being pulled to Austin by the many investors who live there and want the ventures they fund to be closer to them.
    
    Accelerators could go a long way toward easing Austin’s pull, Woodin said, pointing to Geekdom’s recently bringing the Gener8tor Cybersecurity Accelerator to San Antonio.</p>
